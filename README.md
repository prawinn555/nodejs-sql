# Create a simple RESTful CRUD with NodeJS and MongoDB.

Hi, Welcome to my project.
Here, you will find example code to create a RESTful service, using the following frameworks

* NodeJS as the server
* MongoDB as database
* SwaggerUI for NodeJS as the user interface to invoke the REST operations

Our CRUD service allow you to

* create a simple object ( product)
* list products
* get a product by id
* update a product
* delete a product


With Mongoose framework, you will see that the code to read/write objects in database is extremely simple and concise :).
